Bamboo pipes are simple duct flutes designed for use by amateur musicians in preference to the recorder. They were designed by Miss Margaret James in the late 1920s to reproduce the full warm tone of a Sicilian goatherd's pipe. Since that time the Pipers' Guild has spread their use in school and amateur circles over much of the world. It is part of the ethos of the Pipers' Guild that players should make their own pipes (see, for example, the booklet on display), and the instruments shown here were made and played by the late Irene Bennett of Bloxham and were given in her memory by A.H.

BOWS. The idea of rubbing a string to make it vibrate and so to sound seems to have been invented in Central Asia around 800 AD; before that date all string instruments were plucked. The first bows were roughened sticks or grass stems, but the wooden stick, with hair attached to each end, was certainly in use by the 10th century. Its used spread both east and west through Byzantium and the Islamic areas of North Africa and Spain. Early European fiddle bows were strongly arched, becoming straighter during the later Middle Ages with the introduction of the frog, the piece of horn or wood inserted at the handle end to keep the hair away from the stick. Early violin bows were usually short, since the violin was a dance music instrument which was best played with short, strongly accented bow strokes. Viol bows were longer, since a sustained sound was more suited to consort music. With the development of the violin sonata in the late 17th century, the longer Italian sonata bow was introduced and eventually replaced the short French dance bow, Methods of adjusting the hair tension, first with a wire bridle hooked into a series of notches, the cremallire, and then the screw, were invented in the same century. With the desire for a stronger violin sound in the second half of the 18th century, the point of the bow was deepened to hold that end of the hair away from the stick also, and the inward camber, or curve, of the stick was developed to make the bow stronger and deliver more sound still. The principal developers of the modern bow were, in England Edward Dodd (1705-1810) and in France Tourte pre and his two sons, Xavier (known as l'An)(c. 1740-80) and Franois, the greatest of all bow makers (1745-1835). William Retford (1875-1970), whose tools and models are on display here, was one of the most famous English makers of recent times.

The first bows were roughened sticks or grass stems, but the wooden stick, with hair attached to each end, was certainly in use by the 10th century. Its used spread both east and west through Byzantium and the Islamic areas of North Africa and Spain. Early European fiddle bows were strongly arched, becoming straighter during the later Middle Ages with the introduction of the frog, the piece of horn or wood inserted at the handle end to keep the hair away from the stick. Early violin bows were usually short, since the violin was a dance music instrument which was best played with short, strongly accented bow strokes. Viol bows were longer, since a sustained sound was more suited to consort music. With the development of the violin sonata in the late 17th century, the longer Italian sonata bow was introduced and eventually replaced the short French dance bow, Methods of adjusting the hair tension, first with a wire bridle hooked into a series of notches, the cremallire, and then the screw, were invented in the same century. With the desire for a stronger violin sound in the second half of the 18th century, the point of the bow was deepened to hold that end of the hair away from the stick also, and the inward camber, or curve, of the stick was developed to make the bow stronger and deliver more sound still. The principal developers of the modern bow were, in England Edward Dodd (1705-1810) and in France Tourte pre and his two sons, Xavier (known as l'An)(c. 1740-80) and Franois, the greatest of all bow makers (1745-1835).

This stunning carved recorder is believed to have originated in Nuremburg, Germany in about 1700.  Its maker is unknown but resembles similar instruments by Benedikt Gahn.  It is thought that this recorder is actually the sum of two different instruments due to the intricate carvings around the mouth-piece area and then lack of carving on other sections.  It is likely that the bottom half of the instrument was added at a later date.

The particular horn I sent you shows some damage. It also has some obstruction in the interior tubing, but the horn id still displayable in the collection if you so desire.

The mouthpiece is a modified 10 1/2 C Bach trumpet type. This was not uncommon for Army buglers since the issued mouthpieces were inferior compared to professional standards.

 In this case, however, it is a bit unusual as the standard practice was to use a cornet mouthpiece since the shank fit was better. The mouthpiece with this horn has a trumpet shank that has been ground down to fit. I suspect a recent owner did this. It would be more properly displayed with a period cornet mouthpiece.
